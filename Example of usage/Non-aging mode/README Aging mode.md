# Aging Mode Usage Guide

## Overview

This document serves as a basic guide for utilizing the Aging Mode within the JV processor. Note that this guide does not encompass all features or error-checking capabilities, focusing instead on core functionalities for ease of use.

## Quick Start

1. **Select TimeLine**: When using the Aging Mode, it's mandatory to select a TimeLine. This will be used to track the aging of the devices over the specified time intervals.

2. **Choose Data Directory**: After choosing a Timeline, start by clicking on the "Choose a directory" button to pick the folder that includes sub-folders with your raw IV data. Ensure that these sub-folders do not contain any further sub-folders within them.

3. **Pixel Manager**: The Pixel Manager is also available in Aging Mode. This tool allows you to average multiple pixels into a single device, which can streamline the analysis and enhance data representation. This feature is designed for users who require more complex data handling.

4. **Active Area Configuration**: Absence of an "active area" file necessitates manually specifying the active area for the devices. By default, an "Identical AA" is presumed to apply the same active area across all devices.

5. **Additional Settings**: In the 'Additional Settings' section, you can set the light intensity and the distance to the light source, as well as tweak the Excel settings. Advanced users can utilize 'Filters' for more refined data analysis.

6. **Processing Data**: Unlike the Non-Aging Mode, the 'Select' option is not available. All data within the chosen directory and its sub-folders will be processed automatically.

7. **View Results**: After processing, the results will be displayed, offering insights into the photovoltaic parameters and degradation over time.

## Important Notes

- The main directory should only contain sub-folders with IV data; sub-folders within these are not permitted.
- Ensure that the TimeLine is correctly set to reflect the intended aging study.
- Accurate light intensity and distance measurements are crucial for reliable results.
- The 'Filters' option is designed for users with advanced knowledge of data processing and should be used accordingly.

Utilize the Aging Mode to effectively analyze the longevity and stability of solar cell devices.
