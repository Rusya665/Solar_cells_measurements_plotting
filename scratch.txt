Question to ask:
1. What is the current hierarchy for the storing the data? I mean were in the path to raw data file is the name of the
project/bath/any-indicator?
2. Do we need some sorting?
3. Check all potentiostats output. It seems like Gamry returns current as I, but not as mI
4. Some data contains multiple axis crossing (sign changes along I or V columns in data). Which one shall we keep?

Things to do:
1. Apply sorting if said so in Q2.
